# Sort-Comperator
A project that compares various sort algorithms with three different input types within Analysis of Algorithms course.

## How It Works
There are three different input types and for each type program produceses twelve inputs with different sizes. The program's goal is to find median value by running insertion sort, mergesort , max heap approach, quickselect and quickselect with median of three for comparing running times and basic operation count of stated algorithms.
